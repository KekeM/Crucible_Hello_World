# Crucible_Hello_World
Testing Code Review Software's

Crucible is a collaborative code review application by Australian software company Atlassian. Like other Atlassian products, Crucible is a Web-based application primarily aimed at enterprise, and certain features that enable peer review of a codebase may be considered enterprise social software.

Atlassian Crucible is web-based code review software designed for enterprise-level organisations. It integrates with Perforce, CVS, Subversion, Git, and more. Crucible software complements other tools in the Atlassian software suite such as Bitbucket, Confluence, Fisheye and Jira, but it can also be used independently. The crucible code reviews provided by this software allow for significantly better organisation within teams, and thus the potential for a higher quality of code.

# Why Crucible
Atlassian Crucible automates the organisation of a peer review, which is an important part of software development. In many organisations, team members may not commit code without a co-worker examining their changes. Despite their importance, without tools like Atlassian Crucible peer reviews are likely to occur far less frequently, and when they do occur, they are significantly harder to execute without error.

Atlassian Crucible allows for all developers involved in a review to contribute to the project in a collaborative and co-ordinated manner, whilst also greatly reducing the scope for error and mis-communication. No longer is it necessary to communicate comments and approvals by email, and reviews will always be based on the current versions of the source code.

# Key Features of Atlassian Crucible

Better teamwork, better code – flag changes to the source code and show your team what you plan to do.

    Crucible is a collaborative code review application by Australian software company Atlassian. Like other Atlassian products, Crucible is 
    a Web-based application primarily aimed at enterprise, and certain features that enable peer review of a codebase may be considered 
    enterprise social software.

    Crucible is particularly tailored to distributed teams and facilitates asynchronous review and commenting on code. Crucible also integrates 
    with popular source control tools such as Git and Subversion. Crucible is not open source, but customers are allowed to view and modify the 
    code for their own use.

    /* Fisheye and Crucible are two separate products that are highly integrated with one another. Fisheye provides the ability to browse, 
    search, and report from your repository data as it has the ability to index your entire repository history. Crucible, on the other hand, 
    provides code review features */
