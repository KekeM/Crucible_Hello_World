# Crucible_Hello_World
Testing Code Review Software's

Crucible is a collaborative code review application by Australian software company Atlassian. Like other Atlassian products, Crucible is a Web-based application primarily aimed at enterprise, and certain features that enable peer review of a codebase may be considered enterprise social software.

Atlassian Crucible is web-based code review software designed for enterprise-level organisations. It integrates with Perforce, CVS, Subversion, Git, and more. Crucible software complements other tools in the Atlassian software suite such as Bitbucket, Confluence, Fisheye and Jira, but it can also be used independently. The crucible code reviews provided by this software allow for significantly better organisation within teams, and thus the potential for a higher quality of code.

# Why Crucible
Atlassian Crucible automates the organisation of a peer review, which is an important part of software development. In many organisations, team members may not commit code without a co-worker examining their changes. Despite their importance, without tools like Atlassian Crucible peer reviews are likely to occur far less frequently, and when they do occur, they are significantly harder to execute without error.

Atlassian Crucible allows for all developers involved in a review to contribute to the project in a collaborative and co-ordinated manner, whilst also greatly reducing the scope for error and mis-communication. No longer is it necessary to communicate comments and approvals by email, and reviews will always be based on the current versions of the source code.
